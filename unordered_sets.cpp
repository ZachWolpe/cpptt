 * Similar to a set, however the elements are not ordered.
 * Similar to a map, however there is no key-value pair.
 * 
 * It is effectively a map with only keys.
 * 
 * Therefore, Big O is:
 *    - Insertion:      O(1)
 *    - Deletion:       O(1)
 *    - Access/lookup:  O(1)
 * 
 * More efficient than vectors.
 * 
 * Note that no duplicates are allowed.
